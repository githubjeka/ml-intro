    "\n",
    "In some cases, especially when there are a large number of features, when not all of them are informative, and some of them are correlated, it can be useful to reduce the dimension of the feature space. This mean that instead of $d$ original features, we will go to $d'\\ll d$ new ones. And if earlier our data were presented in the form of an $n√ód$ matrix, then it will presented as a $n√ód'$.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two popular dimensionality reduction approaches:\n",
    "- select new features from existing features;\n",
    "- extract the new features by transforming old ones, for example, by making $d'$ different linear combinations of columns of an $n√ód$ matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "One widely used dimensionality reduction technique is the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). This method allows you to construct any number $d'\\leq d$ of new features in such a way that they are the most informative (in some sense).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `scikit-learn` module has several implementations of singular value decomposition. We will use the `TruncatedSVD` class from the `decomposition` submodule.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** The singular value decomposition of the matrix $M$ is usually written as $M=U \\Sigma V^{*}$. `TruncatedSVD`, in turn, returns only the $d'$ first columns of the matrix $U$."

Even if we use the same metric function when calculating the distance between points in the data, after applying dimensionality reduction or other data transformations, we will (not always) get different silhouette scores.

Unlike singular value decomposition, this it is non-linear transformation.

Mathematical details can be found, for example, [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding).\n",
